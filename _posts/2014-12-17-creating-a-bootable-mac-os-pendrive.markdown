Upgraded your MacBook with a new SSD? Want to update the OS to Yosemite with a clean install?

The best (and fastest) way to do this, is using a bootable USB flash drive with the desired version of Mac OS in it.

You will need the installer of the desired version of Mac OS and a USB flash drive with at least 8GB of space (The drive will be completly erased before the process).

**Starting**

You can download the installer of the Mac OS version you want, using the App Store.

Then you need to use a tool called *createinstallmedia*, that can be found inside the installer of Mac OS X, to create a bootable pendrive.

Open your favorite terminal app, and type:
{% highlight bash %}
  sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app
{% endhighlight %}

**What happened?**

We called the *createinstallmedia* tool, sending two parameters:

1. *volume*: This is a path to the volume (USB flash drive) that will be used
2. *applicationpath*: This path leads to the installer app itself, in my case "Install OS X Yosemite.app"

**Installing Mac OS X from flash drive**

All you need to do is reboot your Mac OS X, with the USB flash drive plugged in, and keep the **option** key pressed down.

Then you'll be able to choose your new flash drive as a boot option, and follow the instrutions on screen.
