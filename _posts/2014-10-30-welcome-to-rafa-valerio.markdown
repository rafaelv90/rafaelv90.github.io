I've been working with software development for 5+ years. Through these years, I have faced many problems and challenges, and for each one of them, a solution was created.

Now, I decided to keep a track of my solutions, and why not, share them with the internet.

As a media addicted, sometimes I will share things not directly related to programming. So wait for games, movies and books indications / reviews.

I also have a game critics website with a friend, called [Ataque Crítico][ataquecritico] (*portuguese only*).

Feel free to say hi at [@rafaelvalerio][twitter].

See you around!
